# 2.0.0 April 29, 2014
### Notable changes and features
- Front-end:
    * Floating-point type network ports now supported
- User interface:
    * New network editor based on Eclipse Graphiti SDK. It can be used exactly in the same way as the original one but provides more flexibility for future improvements. Some exclusive features are already available:
        - Instances have different colors if assigned to networks, actors, or nothing.
        - All ports are displayed when an instance is refined.
        - Automatic layout (2 different algorithms).
        - Easy creation of connections: Drag and drop from a port to another
        - Easy creation of refined instances: Drag and drop an actor/network from the project to the current network (this also can be used to update refinement of existing instance, see #77).
        - Better control on properties definitions (variables, parameters, connection size, etc.) [#46].
        - Automatically group a set of selected instances in a new network. Selection is replaced by a new instance, refined on the newly created network, with all connections updated.
        - Automatically replace an instance refined on a network by the content of the network (all instances and connections).
    * CAL editor:
        - Warning on useless imports of units.
    * Miscellaneous
        - A default 'src' folder is created in each new Orcc project.
- Back-ends:
    * [C] Profiling capabilities (actors workload, communication, firings) thanks to code instrumentation: Generate an XML file that can be pretty printed afterwards.
    * [C] Dynamic mapping of actors on multi-core processors (different strategies are available). Mapping algorithms can also be used as independant program called Orcc-map.
    * [C] Global optimization of the generated code:
        - Avoid copy of tokens into local variables that are used as procedure arguments when FIFO accesses are aligned.
    * [C] Optimization of multi-core communications thanks to cache-efficient FIFO implementations.
    * [C] Easy kernel optimization using annotation in CAL code. This has been tested using SSE kernels in the HEVC decoder.

        - Use "@DEBUG" annotation on actor header to display its internal scheduling during the execution.
        - Add option to find array out-of-bounds accesses using asserts.
    * [C/Simulator] Enable easy configuration of FIFO size thanks to an XML file (known as BXDF).
    * [C] Runtime library improvements:
        - Easy import of external libraries (Metis and OpenHEVC).
        - Use data structure representing dataflow-related information.
    * [TTA] Display estimation of actor memory consumption during code generation.
    * [TTA] Add support of code compressor to reduce memory consumption.
    * [Promela] Better, stronger and faster.
    * New DAL backend inheriting from the C backend has been added: This backend targets the Distributed Application Layer, a manycore-oriented programming framework developed at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

### Bugfixes

    * New 'COMPA' backend which generates C source code, without any dependency to external
    libraries (SDL, pthreads, etc.). This backend can't compile classical applications, because
    they use Display.cal and needs to link with SDL. This backend was needed by members of COMPA
    research project (see http://compa-ietr.insa-rennes.fr)
- User interface:
    * Improve code completion.

    * Fix NullPointerException occuring when a wrong XDF path is set.
- Backends:
    * Disable threaded generation to fix random bugs in generated files (without performance lost).
    * (TTA) Transform all boolean variables in i8 since TCE do not support boolean.
