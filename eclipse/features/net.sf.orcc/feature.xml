      The Open RVC-CAL Compiler (Orcc) is a collection of support tools under BSD license created by IETR/INSA Rennes for the RVC-CAL dataflow programming language. Its primary purpose is to provide developers with a compiler infrastructure to allow several languages and combination of languages (in the case of co-design) to be generated from RVC-CAL actors and XDF networks.
